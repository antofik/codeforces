Alex enjoyed playing Minesweeper that time. He imagined that he saved world from bombs planted by terrorists, but he rarely won.</p><p>Alex has grown up since then, so he easily wins the most difficult levels. This quickly bored him, and he thought: what if the computer gave him invalid fields in the childhood and Alex could not win because of it?</p><p>He needs your help to check it.</p><p>A Minesweeper field is a rectangle $$$n \times m$$$, where each cell is either empty, or contains a digit from $$$1$$$ to $$$8$$$, or a bomb. The field is valid if for each cell: </p><ul> <li> if there is a digit $$$k$$$ in the cell, then exactly $$$k$$$ neighboring cells have bombs. </li><li> if the cell is empty, then all neighboring cells have no bombs. </li></ul><p>Two cells are neighbors if they have a common side or a corner (i. e. a cell has at most $$$8$$$ neighboring cells).</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 100$$$) — the sizes of the field.</p><p>The next $$$n$$$ lines contain the description of the field. Each line contains $$$m$$$ characters, each of them is &quot;<span class="tex-font-style-tt">.</span>&quot; (if this cell is empty), &quot;<span class="tex-font-style-tt">*</span>&quot; (if there is bomb in this cell), or a digit from $$$1$$$ to $$$8$$$, inclusive.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>Print &quot;<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>&quot;, if the field is valid and &quot;<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>&quot; otherwise.</p><p>You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrarily.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Examples</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input</div><pre>3 3<br />111<br />1*1<br />111<br /></pre></div><div class="output"><div class="title">Output</div><pre>YES</pre></div><div class="input"><div class="title">Input</div><pre>2 4<br />*.*.<br />1211<br /></pre></div><div class="output"><div class="title">Output</div><pre>NO</pre></div></div></div><div class="note"><div class="section-title">Note</div><p>In the second example the answer is &quot;<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>&quot; because, if the positions of the bombs are preserved, the first line of the field should be <span class="tex-font-style-tt">*2*1</span>.</p><p>You can read more about Minesweeper in <a>Wikipedia's article</a>.</p></div></div><p>  </p></div>
